<!-- # My Research in High Energy Physics

## Graph Neural Networks in CMS  
I work on **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to analyze multi-lepton final states.  
- **Using GCNConv layers** for event classification.  
- **Incorporating kinematic properties** into graph structures.  
- **Applying BCE loss** for high P_T track identification.  

## Ongoing Projects  
ðŸš€ **ML-based Anomaly Detection in CMS**  
ðŸš€ **New Physics Search in Lepton-Jet Final States**   -->
